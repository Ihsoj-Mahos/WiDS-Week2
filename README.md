# **Week 2 : Assignment**

In this assignment for the project "Diving into ML", we shall explore our first ML model, namely logistic regression. This programming assignment is based on the binary classification problem. You have to classify the labelled dataset in the 2D plane appropriately and explore how the decision boundary of the classifier works. 

The resources for this week can be found in the resources folder in the repo.

This week's programming assignment has a jupyter notebook which contains the problem statement. You are supposed to fill in missing code wherever indicated and provide detailed observations wherever asked.

Your assignment will be scored on the basis of : 

* Error-free execution
* Accuracy of results obtained
* Well-formatted graphs
* Detailed analysis whenever observations are asked
* Good programming practices (such as comments, indentation)

The deadline for the submission of this assignment is 11 January, 11:59 PM

Any doubts/suggestions can be asked on the group. All resources required including the libraries to be used, the dataset to be used have been linked in the notebook.
